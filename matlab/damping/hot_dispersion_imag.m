% kperp:  perpendicular component of k vector
% kpar:   parallel component of k vector
% w:      frequency
% m:      resonances, a vector of resonances to sum in this integrand

% Ns:     vector of number densities in m^-3
% ms:     vector of masses
% nus:    vector of collision frequencies
% B0:     the magnetic field magnitude
% TOL:    integration tolerance

%              'accurate', a better quadrature method that almost always
%              converges, but is slower
